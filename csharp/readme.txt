This is the main directory for the toolkit. This file
is a set of somewhat random notes taken by Jack while
looking at this stuff.

UrakawaToolkitAllProjects.sln is the main project.
It needs VS 2003.

Install NUnit, get it from <http://www.nunit.org/>.

Install TestDriven, from <http://www.testdriven.net/>.

You also need MSXML4. Google for it, download from MS.
Note that the SDK isn't installed by default, you should
select it manually when running the installer.

Build the project. You cannot run it but you can run the
tests in UnitTests with the "Run Tests" command in the
contextual menu. You can also inspect the tests by firing up
the NUnit application and opening
urakawa\UnitTests\bin\Debug\UnitTests.dll.
