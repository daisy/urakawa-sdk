Urakawa Project
Sample Applications
Overview
---------------------

(A) Objectives

1) Several mini-applications.
2) Each application is stand-alone, can be compiled and run independently, to demonstrate key concepts in a particular domain of the Urakawa Data Model, or more broadly SDK.
3) Not necessarily GUI, but command-line: these samples target software programmers, so they have to showcase the programmatic .
4) At least one GUI application, e.g. to demonstrate an application of the event framework to the MVC paradigm.


(B) Main Topics

1) Metadata
2) Media (media.data.ManagedMedia)
3) XUK
4) Visitor
5) Events
6) Navigator
7) Playback
8) Recording 
9) Properties: existing (channel, xml) + extend (custom properties)
10) Undo-Redo

(C) Application Scenarios

1) Metadata
	1-a) "manually create metadata using factory + foreach metadata display in console"
		* Create Project+Presentation (empty)
		* programmatically fill Project.metadata
		* for each metadata => printout

2) Media (media.data.ManagedMedia)


3) XUK
	3-a) 

4) Visitor
5) Events
6) Navigator
7) Playback
8) Recording 
9) Properties: existing (channel, xml) + extend (custom properties)
10) Undo-Redo


* Visitor (e.g. no GUI, read XUK with text/html media in many tree nodes, visit to extract a single string for the HTML document, and print-out or serialize in UTF-8 file)
* Managed-Audio (e.g. import existing WAV files, merge, split, cleanup, save as XUK)
* XUK (e.g. custom extensions of XukAble object types with user-defined QNames in resulting XUK)
* Events (audio playback, registered listeners => output in console)
* etc.


(D) Implementation

1) VisualStudio C# Project (to facilitate debugging with the current C# SDK implementation, but later we can provide Mono scripts)

2) Romain as the prime candidate for developing these sample apps (he has a fresh and critical look on the SDK).
