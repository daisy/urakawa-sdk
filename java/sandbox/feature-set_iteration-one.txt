The core object model
	1. has nodes
	2. has metadata

The nodes
	1. have semantic annotations:
		a. global navigation.  
			- @question: Like what?
		b. logical structure
			- e.g., chapters, section, level, footnote
			- @question: in general,does this mean annotations which reflect dtbook?  and then, @question: what is the defined behavior for cases where dtbook might be difficult to accomodate, as in what we have been calling "mixed-content" situations.
			c. timing and synchronization
				- e.g., par, seq, begin
				- @question: what does this look like in practice?
			d. user-domain-specific custom annotations
				- @question: should we make some notes describing the limitations of our annotation model?
	
Things you can ask the core data model
	1. Via logical navigation
	2. Via selection

@proposed addition for first iteration:
Validation	
	1. Feedback on invalid XML input
