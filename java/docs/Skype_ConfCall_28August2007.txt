Hot Topics:
(
Taken from:
trunk/urakawa/architecture/docs/Urakawa_SDK-ReviewNotes.txt
)

1) Undo/Redo:
===> #47, #48, #49, #53
- transaction model needs polishing (automatic command compositing)
- decision about automatic command when calling low-level data model methods that modify the state (undo-redo manager isActive(), etc.) => probably feature drop. UPDATE: yes, feature dropped.
- built-in SDK commands: every single method that modifies the state of the XUK (serialized/persistent data model). For example, an application can define custom Commands for GUI selection, in order to make user selections undoable.

ACTIONS:
@Daniel
	- rewrite the erroneous API-Doc comments, and use the common undo+redo stack metaphor (it's actually implementation -dependent, but helps for documenting the expected mechanism).
	- modify developer guidelines for using the UndoRedoManager (without automatic command generation).
	- use a "command" sub-package for each area of the design where the data model is modified by method calls.
	- Expose all the functionality at the UndoRedoManager level (such as list of command descriptions in the undo stack for UI rendering)

@Ole
	- sync with Daniel at later stage (next week call)

2) sync between design and impl regarding the refactored design of TreeNode's generic Property (canBeAddedTo() etc.)
===> #33

@Ole
	- continue implementation (in parallel with export() across Presentation) + sync at next week call.

3) Channel.canAccept(Media), removal of MediaType
===> #36

@Ole
	- Half-done (sync at next week call)

4) "copy nodes across different presentations" design seems ok, how about impl ?
===> #22.

@Ole
	- Half-done, sync with Daniel's design at next call.

5) Unit-testing
@Romain
	- come on-board with media.data testing (split, merge, clips, streams, cleanup, etc.) => review how NUnit is currently used for testing, maybe needs changes.
	- Minimal test document for this particular area of the SDK design. There is not enough staff to write test documentation for other things like XUK, Navigator, etc. 

6) implementation agnostic XUK schema, XUK custom extensions.
postponed to next call, or even later next month with Obi's team.
