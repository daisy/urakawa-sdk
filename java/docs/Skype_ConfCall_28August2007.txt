Hot Topics:

1) Undo/Redo:
- transaction model needs polishing (automatic command compositing)
- decision about automatic command when calling low-level data model methods that modify the state (undo-redo manager isActive(), etc.) => probably feature drop.
- built-in SDK commands: every single method that modifies the state of the XUK (serialized/persistent data model). For example, an application can define custom Commands for GUI selection, in order to make user selections undoable.
===> this is #47, #48, #49, #53 from the list.

2) sync between design and impl regarding the refactored design of TreeNode's generic Property
===> this is #33 from the list.

3) Channel.canAccept(Media), removal of MediaType
===> this is #36 from the list.

4) "copy nodes across different presentations" design seems ok, how about impl ? (probably best postponed to next week, when new Property design is in place)
===> this is #22 from the list.
