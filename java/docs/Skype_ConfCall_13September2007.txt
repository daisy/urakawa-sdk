1) Undo/Redo

Updated developer guide:

http://urakawa.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/urakawa/trunk/urakawa/architecture/docs/Urakawa_API_guide.html#commandsundo-redo


To help the migration work of Obi's CommandManager to SDK's UndoRedoManager

http://urakawa.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/urakawa/trunk/urakawa/common/Obi_SDK_UndoRedo.txt

(to be completed before Amsterdam to include the SDK's built-in Commands: work in progress, analysis of Obi's business logic behind reversible Commands that relate to media "asset manager")


2) Unit-Testing

Namespace problem in C#:

(org.daisy.)urakawa.core.TreeNode
unittest.(org.daisy.)urakawa.core.TreeNode

global ::urakawa;
using urakawa;

Workaround => remove the "unittest" prefix, set a global project namespace, and remove the "urakawa" folder.


3) Raised concern:

Quality of low-level API doc comments (methods, etc.) is no sufficient.

The UML doc and developer guide are complementary and provide all required information, but the API doc is what a developer see when using auto-comletion in the IDE (with popup comments).

e.g.: With* interfaces: aggregation vs composition, "who owns what" ? (set/get)

Question: in an IDE, if a concrete class implements methods but does not duplicate the method comments from the interface => auto-completion on the class object instance shows the upper-level comments ??


Next call: Monday 17 15:00 CEST or Tuesday 18 14:00 CEST, with Obi team ?
Daniel in AMS on Thursday 20 and Friday 21. Will talk with Marisa and Julien about undo-redo.
